# Rules for Your Card Game:

**Number of Players:** 2

**Objective:** To reduce the opponent's HP to 0.

## Setup:

- Each player starts with 10,000 HP and a common deck of 120 cards.
- Shuffle the 120 cards in the player's deck and draw 4 cards as the player's starting hand.

- Each player's card field consists of 9 distinguished cards that are placed face down at the beginning of the game. These cards can only be activated if specific conditions are met during the game.

- The rest of the cards are placed in a common deck, which is used for drawing cards during the game.

## GamePlay:

- Each turn consists of the following phases: Draw Phase, Main Phase 1, Battle Phase, Main Phase 2, and End Phase.
- Player cant attack during its first round
- Every card can do one effect or attack unless a spacifc spell card used
- The first one to start is randomly
- During the Draw Phase, the player draws 1 card from their deck.
- During the Main Phase 1, the player can play any cards from their hand or activate any card effects.
- The player can put any number of their cards on the field vertically or two cards horizontally.
- But Note the player can only play one horizontal card per entire round.
- Each vertical card is face-up, but each horizontal card is face-down and can be either a trap card or a support card.
- Only dummy cards, chad cards, and trap cards can be played horizontally
- Horizontal cards are cards can do either of those two : give its def states (DP) to any card in the player field
without his opponet knows but with this it will become 0 def so if the the enemy attacked it ;he will do direct dmg to the player
or it can be chose to keep its def but in any case it cant attack unless he opponet attacks it first
- Note dummy cards are spacifc as they dont have AP nor DP but if they attacked the player wont take any damage
- supporting coming from two things : a horizontal card  equipment card or cspell card
- During the Battle Phase, the player can attack the opponent's HP by choosing a vertical card to attack with. (in some cases)
- If the opponent has a face-down card on the field, it can be revealed as a trap card and activated to counter the attack or cause damage to the attacking player or support its own player with def states.
- During the Main Phase 2, the player can play any remaining cards from their hand or activate any card effects.
- At the end of the turn, any unused cards in the player's hand are discarded.(not determined yet!)

### **Additional Knowledge**:

- Each card has its own attack points (AP) and defensive points (DP), which are used in battle.
- Starpower are stars that indicates the power of the card.
- The Distinguished Card Field can accept any card that enters it and give it effects.
- Cant just play cards that have over three starpower.
- To play cards over three starpower it could be done with those ways
 by special spell cards or by merging cards or by using equipment cards

- The game ends when one player's HP reaches 0.

## **DeckBuilding**:

- Each player can collocate 100 cards, but can only have a maximum of 60 cards in their deck at any time.
- then the two player deck is mixed and shuffled together so the common draw deck in the game is 120 cards
- This means that players need to carefully choose which cards to include in their deck and which to remove.

### **TheCards**:

- In addition to the standard card types (chads, spell, trap), there could be additional card types such as equipment cards, which can be attached to a chad to give it additional abilities or stats.
- equipment cards adds AP and DP and powerstars
- merge carding is by discarding cards or spells
- Some cards may have restrictions on when they can be played or used. For example, a spell card might require the player to have a certain type of monster on the field before it can be activated.
- Certain cards may have effects that can only be activated by sacrificing other cards on the field or from the player's hand. This adds an additional layer of strategy to the game, as players need to decide whether to sacrifice their resources for a powerful effect or they may have disadvantages on its own player.
- Some cards may have a special ability that triggers when they are destroyed or sent to the graveyard. This can make players think twice about attacking or removing certain cards from the field.
- The game could have a ban list, which is a list of cards that are deemed too powerful or disruptive to be used in official matches. This helps to maintain balance in the game and prevent certain cards or strategies from dominating the meta.
- In addition to regular matches, there could be special events or tournaments with their own unique rules and prizes. For example, a tournament could require players to build a deck around a certain theme or archetype, or have special rules such as no trap cards allowed.

### Optional-Rules:

- The game could have a limited hand size of 5 cards, forcing players to carefully choose which cards to keep and which to discard.(not determined yet)
  
- Each turn,
 players could draw 2 cards instead of the usual 1,
 but must also discard 1 card from their hand.(not determined yet)
- Some cards could have effects that can only be automatically activated during the opponent's turn,
  adding an element of surprise and forcing players to think about their opponent's potential moves.(not determined yet)
- Players could have the ability to place "dummy" cards on the field,
 which look like regular cards but have no effect.
  This can be used to mislead the opponent and force them to waste resources attacking or removing the dummy card.(so determined)
- The game could have a **"fog of war"** mechanic,
 where the opponent's hand and deck are hidden from view.
  This adds an additional layer of mystery and forces players to make educated guesses about their opponent's potential moves.(determined as spell card)
- Players could have the ability to trade or swap cards with their opponent.
 This can be used as a bargaining tool to gain an advantage or to trick the opponent into giving away a valuable card.(quite determined)
